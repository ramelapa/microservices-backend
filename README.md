# microservices-backend
Monorepo for the backend microservices

Each micro-frontend (Finance, HR, Marketing) requires its own backend microservice for: ✅ Handling business logic
✅ Managing data storage
✅ Serving APIs to micro-frontends

We will create the following backend services:

    Finance Service → Node.js (Express)
    HR Service → Python (Flask)
    Marketing Service → Java (Spring Boot)
    Generative UI Engine → Node.js

Each microservice will have: ✅ REST API Endpoints
✅ Database Support (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
✅ Docker & Kubernetes Support
